You will find here a code samples ready to resue. In this repo you can look for a menu toogler or a video player controlers, etc. I did it on my way of coding. It works for me but 

# 1. nav - toggler

 function wich toggle (open / close) mobil menu in a smooth way 
 
 # 2. video - controlers 
 
 set of basic controls with custom style and behavior 
 
 # 3. form - inputs 
 
 interesting example how inputs placeholders can behave  
 
 # 4. goole map with api  
 
 it's example how to implement google map in a web with api query. Accordind Google Maps docs I built initMpa function.

Generaly JS code is pasted in htnl file as a script.
